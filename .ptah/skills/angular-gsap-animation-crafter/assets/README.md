## Usage

### Using a Page Template

1. **Copy the template** into your project
2. **Rename** the component selector and class
3. **Customize** section content, colors, and timing
4. **Add/remove sections** as needed

### Using Section Templates

1. **Select sections** that match your needs
2. **Copy each template** into your project
3. **Combine in a parent component** or routing
4. **Customize** each section independently

### Combining Sections

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { ParallaxHeroComponent } from './sections/parallax-hero.component';
import { SplitPanelTimelineComponent } from './sections/split-panel-timeline.component';
import { FeatureShowcaseCardsComponent } from './sections/feature-showcase-cards.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-landing-page',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [ParallaxHeroComponent, SplitPanelTimelineComponent, FeatureShowcaseCardsComponent],
  template: `
    <app-parallax-hero />
    <app-feature-showcase-cards />
    <app-split-panel-timeline />
  `,
})
export class LandingPageComponent {}
```

## Customization Points

Each template file includes detailed comments explaining:

- Animation type and best use cases
- Key features used
- Customization points (timing, colors, easing, layout)
- Configuration examples

Look for these comment patterns:

```typescript
/**
 * Customization Points:
 * - Duration: Change transition speed
 * - Easing: Modify animation feel
 * - Colors: Update to match brand
 */
```
