description: 'Development workflow orchestration for software engineering tasks. Supports 8 task types: FEATURE, BUGFIX, REFACTORING, DOCUMENTATION, RESEARCH, DEVOPS, SAAS_INIT, CREATIVE. Each type has an optimized workflow (full/partial/minimal) with specialist agents and user validation checkpoints. TRIGGER for ANY implementation task — this is the DEFAULT entry point for all engineering work.'

# Orchestration Skill

Multi-phase development workflow orchestration with dynamic strategies and user validation checkpoints. **You are the orchestrator** - coordinate agents, manage state, verify deliverables.

## Pre-flight: Task Analysis (RUN FIRST)

**Before any other step**, classify the user's request:

1. **Detect task type** using the keyword matrix below
2. **Select workflow depth** (Full / Partial / Minimal) based on complexity
3. **Announce** the detected type, selected workflow, and planned agent sequence to the user
4. **Proceed** with the appropriate strategy — never fall back to internal planning or direct coding

If the task type is ambiguous, ask the user to clarify rather than defaulting to direct implementation.

## Quick Start

```
/orchestrate [task description]     # New task
/orchestrate TASK_2025_XXX          # Continue existing task
```

### Strategy Quick Reference

| Task Type     | Strategy Flow                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

| DOCUMENTATION | PM -> Developer -> Style Reviewer                  |
| RESEARCH      | Researcher -> [conditional implementation]         |
| DEVOPS        | PM -> Architect -> DevOps Engineer -> QA           |
| SAAS_INIT     | Discovery -> PM -> Architect -> Team-Leader        |
| CREATIVE      | [ui-ux-designer] -> content-writer -> frontend     |

See [strategies.md](references/strategies.md) for detailed flow diagrams.

## Your Role: Orchestrator

**CRITICAL**: You are the **orchestrator**, NOT the implementer.

### Primary Responsibilities

1. **Delegate to Specialist Agents** - Use Task tool to invoke specialists
2. **Coordinate Workflows** - Manage flow between agents, handle checkpoints
3. **Verify Quality** - Ensure agents complete tasks correctly
4. **Never Implement Directly** - Avoid writing code yourself

### When to Delegate (ALWAYS)

| Task Type      | Agent(s)                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Writing code   | backend-developer, frontend-developer                     |
| Testing        | senior-tester                                             |
| Code review    | code-style-reviewer, code-logic-reviewer, visual-reviewer |
| Research       | researcher-expert                                         |
| Architecture   | software-architect                                        |
| Planning       | project-manager                                           |
| Infrastructure | devops-engineer                                           |

**Default**: When in doubt, delegate. See [agent-catalog.md](references/agent-catalog.md) for all 14 agents.

## Workflow Selection Matrix

### Task Type Detection

| Keywords Present                              | Task Type     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| new SaaS, multi-tenant, Nx monorepo, scaffold | SAAS_INIT     |
| CI/CD, pipeline, Docker, Kubernetes, deploy   | DEVOPS        |
| landing page, marketing, brand, visual        | CREATIVE      |
| implement, add, create, build                 | FEATURE       |
| fix, bug, error, issue                        | BUGFIX        |
| refactor, improve, optimize                   | REFACTORING   |
| document, readme, comment                     | DOCUMENTATION |
| research, investigate, analyze                | RESEARCH      |

**Priority**: SAAS_INIT > DEVOPS > CREATIVE > FEATURE (when multiple keywords present)

### Adaptive Strategy Selection

When analyzing a task, evaluate multiple factors:

| Factor          | Weight | How to Assess                              |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Keywords        | 30%    | Match request against keyword table above  |
| Affected Files  | 25%    | Identify likely affected code paths        |
| Complexity      | 25%    | Simple (<2h), Medium (2-8h), Complex (>8h) |
| Recent Patterns | 20%    | Check last 5 tasks in registry.md          |

**Decision Rules**:

- Top strategy confidence >= 70%: Proceed with that strategy
- Top two strategies within 10 points: Present options to user
- All strategies < 70%: Ask user for clarification

See [strategies.md](references/strategies.md) for detailed selection guidance.

## Core Orchestration Loop

### Mode Detection

```
if ($ARGUMENTS matches /^TASK_2025_\d{3}$/)
    -> CONTINUATION mode (resume existing task)
else
    -> NEW_TASK mode (create new task)
```

### NEW_TASK: Initialization

1. **Read Registry**: `Read(.ptah/specs/registry.md)` - find highest TASK_ID, increment
2. **Create Task Folder**: `mkdir .ptah/specs/TASK_[ID]`
3. **Create Context**: `Write(.ptah/specs/TASK_[ID]/context.md)` with user intent, strategy
4. **Announce**: Present task ID, type, complexity, planned agent sequence

### CONTINUATION: Phase Detection

| Documents Present       | Next Action                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| context.md only         | Invoke project-manager              |
| task-description.md     | User validate OR invoke architect   |
| implementation-plan.md  | User validate OR team-leader MODE 1 |
| tasks.md (PENDING)      | Team-leader MODE 2 (assign batch)   |
| tasks.md (IN PROGRESS)  | Team-leader MODE 2 (verify)         |
| tasks.md (IMPLEMENTED)  | Team-leader MODE 2 (commit)         |
| tasks.md (all COMPLETE) | Team-leader MODE 3 OR QA choice     |
| future-enhancements.md  | Workflow complete                   |

See [task-tracking.md](references/task-tracking.md) for full phase detection.

### Agent Invocation Pattern

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: '[agent-name]',
  description: '[Brief description] for TASK_[ID]',
  prompt: `You are [agent-name] for TASK_[ID].

**Task Folder**: [absolute path]
**User Request**: "[original request]"

[Agent-specific instructions]
See [agent-name].md for detailed instructions.`,
});
```

---

## Validation Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 0.1: CLI Agent Discovery (before any agent invocation)

Run `ptah_agent_list` and present results to user. Ask whether sub-agents should utilize CLI agents as junior helpers. Store selection in `context.md`. Skipped for Minimal pattern tasks or when no CLI agents are available. See [checkpoints.md](references/checkpoints.md) for the full template.

### Standard Checkpoints

After PM or Architect deliverables, present to user:

```
USER VALIDATION CHECKPOINT - TASK_[ID]
[Summary of deliverable]
Reply "APPROVED" to proceed OR provide feedback for revision
```

See [checkpoints.md](references/checkpoints.md) for all checkpoint templates.

---

## Team-Leader Integration

The team-leader operates in 3 modes:

| Mode   | When                    | Purpose                            |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| MODE 1 | After architect         | Create tasks.md with batched tasks |
| MODE 2 | After developer returns | Verify, commit, assign next batch  |
| MODE 3 | All batches COMPLETE    | Final verification, summary        |

### Response Handling

| Team-Leader Says     | Your Action                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| NEXT BATCH ASSIGNED  | Invoke developer with provided prompt |
| BATCH REJECTED       | Re-invoke developer with issues       |
| ALL BATCHES COMPLETE | Invoke MODE 3                         |

See [team-leader-modes.md](references/team-leader-modes.md) for detailed integration.

## Flexible Invocation Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use                     | Flow                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Full    | New features, unclear scope     | PM -> Architect -> Team-Leader -> QA |
| Partial | Known requirements, refactoring | Architect -> Team-Leader -> QA       |
| Minimal | Simple fixes, quick reviews     | Single developer or reviewer         |

---

## CLI Agent Delegation Mode

Enable a **3-tier hierarchy** where sub-agents can delegate focused sub-tasks to CLI agents as junior helpers, speeding up grunt work through parallelization.

```
Tier 1: Claude (Orchestrator) — coordinates workflow
  └── Tier 2: Sub-agents (Senior Leads) — via Agent tool
        └── Tier 3: CLI agents (Junior Helpers) — via ptah_agent_spawn
```

### How It Works

1. **Discovery**: At orchestration start, run `ptah_agent_list` to find available CLI agents
2. **Checkpoint 0.1**: Present available agents to user and ask whether to enable delegation
3. **Injection**: When enabled, every sub-agent prompt gets a CLI delegation instruction block appended
4. **Execution**: Sub-agents decide when to delegate sub-tasks vs do work directly

### Quick Reference

| Aspect                 | Detail                                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Activation**         | Checkpoint 0.1 (auto-discovered, user-confirmed)      |
| **Available agents**   | gemini, codex, copilot, ptah-cli (user-configured)    |
| **Concurrency limit**  | Max 3 CLI agents simultaneously                       |
| **Selection priority** | ptah-cli > gemini > codex > copilot                   |
| **Sub-agent autonomy** | Sub-agents decide when/whether to delegate            |
| **Quality ownership**  | Sub-agents own quality — must review CLI agent output |

### When to Delegate (Sub-agent Guidance)

| Delegate These                              | Keep These                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| File-level analysis and surveys             | Architecture and cross-cutting decisions |
| Test scaffolding and boilerplate generation | User-facing deliverables and synthesis   |
| Parallel reviews across many files          | Git commits                              |
| Config file / Dockerfile generation         | Interactive user questioning             |
| Codebase research and dependency analysis   | Security-critical review decisions       |

See [cli-agent-delegation.md](references/cli-agent-delegation.md) for the comprehensive reference.

### CLI Delegation Prompt Injection

When CLI Agent Mode is active, append this block to every sub-agent's invocation prompt:

```markdown
## CLI Agent Delegation (Junior Helpers)

You have CLI agents available as junior helpers. Use them for focused,
independently-executable sub-tasks to speed up your work.

**Available agents** (from discovery):
[injected agent list from ptah_agent_list results]

**How to delegate:**

1. Spawn: `ptah_agent_spawn { task: "...", cli: "gemini", taskFolder: "...", files: [...] }`
2. Poll: `ptah_agent_status { agentId: "..." }` (repeat until not "running")
3. Read: `ptah_agent_read { agentId: "..." }`
4. Use the results in your deliverable

**How to resume a timed-out/failed agent:**

1. Get session ID: `ptah_agent_status { agentId: "..." }` → note the `CLI Session ID`
2. Resume: `ptah_agent_spawn { task: "Continue the previous task", resume_session_id: "<cliSessionId>", ... }`
   The agent loads the old session context and continues from where it left off.

**Rules:**

- Max 3 concurrent CLI agents
- CLI agents have NO shared context — include ALL necessary info in the task prompt
- CLI agents should NOT commit to git
- YOU own the quality — review CLI agent output before incorporating
- Delegate grunt work, keep synthesis and decisions to yourself
- When a CLI agent times out or fails, **resume it** instead of re-spawning from scratch

**When to delegate:**
[role-specific examples injected per agent type — see agent-catalog.md]
```

## Error Handling

### Validation Rejection

1. Parse feedback into actionable points
2. Re-invoke same agent with feedback
3. Present revised version

### Commit Hook Failure

**NEVER bypass hooks automatically.** Present options:

1. Fix issue (if related)
2. Bypass with --no-verify (if unrelated, with user approval)
3. Stop and report (if critical)

See [checkpoints.md](references/checkpoints.md) for error handling templates.

### Loading Protocol

1. **Always loaded**: This SKILL.md (when skill triggers)
2. **Load on demand**: References when specific guidance needed
3. **Never preload**: All references at once

---

## Key Principles

1. **You are the orchestrator**: Direct tool access, no agent overhead
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Load references only when needed
3. **User validation**: Always get approval for PM/Architect deliverables
4. **Team-leader loop**: 3-mode cycle handles all development coordination
5. **Never bypass hooks**: Always ask user before --no-verify
6. **Single task folder**: All work in parent task folder
