# Agent Godette

v0.3.1

**Per-session model, mode, and reasoning** — switch model, reasoning effort, and permission mode per thread, right from the composer bar.

**Plan · Queue · SceneTree focus** — the agent's TodoWrite plan collapses above the composer, queued follow-up prompts stack underneath it, and any node you've selected in the SceneTree auto-attaches as implicit context on send.

## What it is

A Godot 4 editor plugin that talks to local ACP (Agent Client Protocol) adapters — Claude and Codex run as stdio subprocesses, the editor is the client. No HTTP bridge.

## What it solves

Godot had no in-editor agent. This plugin makes the editor itself the chat surface: attach scene nodes, FileSystem files, or pasted screenshots as context; the agent edits your project in place. No copy-paste between a separate chat app and the editor.

## Credits

Standing on [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)'s shoulders — the ACP transport and most of the UX (plan / queue drawers, composer chips, transcript persistence, tool-call rendering) are modeled directly on Zed's external-agent implementation.
